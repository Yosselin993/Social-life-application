# Social-life-application
Creating a social life application for our Fall 2025 Software Engineering class

The name of our website application is called "___blank____"

"___blank____" is a web application designed to help university students discover, join, and engage with student clubs and organizations. 

We believe every student should have an easy way to find their community. This website application will help students discover clubs that inspire them. Whether tied to career goals or just personal interests. The website will also provide tools to 
help students create new clubs and make it simple to promote and grow their organizations within the university community.



#Environment and Programming languages our team will be using 

We decided that our team will be working in Visual Studio as our main development environment. Drawing inspiration from our software engineering class, each team member will create their own virtual machine configured to run Python. Within each 
virtual machine, a second file will be created for writing individual code contributions. The second file will then be pushed to our shared GitHub repository using separate branches, allowing us to review each otherâ€™s work, collaborate effectively, 
and continuously build upon or enhance existing features.
