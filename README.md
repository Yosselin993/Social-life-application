# Social-life-application
Creating a social life application for our Fall 2025 Software Engineering class

The name of our website application is called UTRGVConnect

UTRGVConnect is a web application designed to help UTRGV students discover, join, and engage with student clubs and organizations. 

We believe every student should have an easy way to find their community. This website application will help students discover clubs that inspire them. Whether tied to career goals or just personal interests. The website will also provide tools to help students create new clubs and make it simple to promote and grow their organizations within the university community.


#Environment and Programming languages our team will be using 

We decided that our team will be working in Visual Studio as our main development environment. Drawing inspiration from our software engineering class, each team member will create their own virtual machine configured to run Python. Within each 
virtual machine, a second file will be created for writing individual code contributions. The second file will then be pushed to our shared GitHub repository using separate branches, allowing us to review each other’s work, collaborate effectively, and continuously build upon or enhance existing features.

The languages we decided to work in are Python, CSS, and HTML. Python will serve as the backend language, handling the logic, data processing, and communication to our database. HTML is the backbone of our website, which defines the text, images, 
links, buttons, and other elements. While CSS will help us style the way our website looks, like the colors, layout, font, and other features. 

#The work method our team will be using 

Our team will follow an agile methodology, working in 7-day sprints. At the end of each sprint, we’ll meet via Zoom to review our accomplishments and set objectives for the next sprint.


#The different features that will be displayed in our website application 
There will be two modes to view the website. One will be the creator mode where the clubs will manage their club content. They can edit their club's information, upload images, post announcements, and assign interest tags. Their displayed features can be a club logo/banner, a section over what the club is about, meeting times and location, announcements, and photos of past events. 
The other mode will be for students who want to explore and join clubs that match their interests. They create an account, so they can save their favorite clubs and notificates from followed clubs. 
Specific features will include a search bar, upcoming events calendar, recent announcements, filter to view certain clubs, and a "take the quiz" section. The interactive quiz will help students who are unsure about what additional clubs to join. After answering a few questions, the system will show them the top three clubs that fits the answers. 
The administrator, which will be us, will be able to oversee the clubs, content, and verify the club registrations. We should be able to remove anything that seems inappropriate for the website.
