# Social-life-application
Creating a social life application for our Fall 2025 Software Engineering class

The name of our website application is called "___blank____"

"___blank____" is a web application designed to help university students discover, join, and engage with student clubs and organizations. 

We believe every student should have an easy way to find their community. This website application will help students discover clubs that inspire them. Whether tied to career goals or just personal interests. The website will also provide tools to help students create new clubs and make it simple to promote and grow their organizations within the university community.
